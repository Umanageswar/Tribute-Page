        <h1>Career</h1><hr>
        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as MS Dhoni, is one of the most        celebrated cricketers in the history of the sport. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India, Dhoni's journey from a small-town boy to an international cricketing icon is nothing short of remarkable.
            Dhoni made his debut in One Day Internationals (ODIs) for India on December 23, 2004, against Bangladesh. Known for his aggressive batting style, he quickly rose to prominence, especially after his explosive 148 against Pakistan in just his fifth ODI. Dhoni's fearless approach and ability to finish games earned him the nickname "Captain Cool."
            In 2007, Dhoni was appointed as the captain of the Indian T20 team for the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in South Africa. Under his leadership, India won the tournament, marking the beginning of a new era in Indian cricket. His calm demeanor and strategic acumen were instrumental in India's success.
            Following the T20 World Cup triumph, Dhoni was named the captain of the Indian ODI and Test teams. He led India to several significant victories, including the 2007-08 CB Series in Australia. In 2009, under his captaincy, India became the No. 1 Test team in the ICC rankings for the first time.
            Dhoni's leadership skills were further demonstrated in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. He led India to victory, ending a 28-year wait for the coveted trophy. Dhoni's unbeaten 91 in the final against Sri Lanka, capped off with a six to seal the win, is one of the most iconic moments in cricket history.
            In 2013, Dhoni achieved another milestone by leading India to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy in England, making him the first captain in history to win all three ICC trophies (T20 World Cup, 50-over World Cup, and Champions Trophy). His ability to lead from the front and stay composed under pressure became his trademark.
            Apart from his international success, Dhoni was also a force in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He captained the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) since the league's inception in 2008, leading them to multiple titles in 2010, 2011, 2018, and 2021. His influence on the team and the league as a whole was profound, making CSK one of the most successful franchises.
            Dhoni's career was also marked by his exceptional wicketkeeping skills. He holds numerous records, including the most dismissals by an Indian wicketkeeper in ODIs and Tests. His lightning-fast stumpings and sharp reflexes made him one of the best wicketkeepers in the world.
            In Test cricket, Dhoni scored 4,876 runs in 90 matches, including six centuries. He retired from Test cricket in December 2014, after leading India in 60 matches. His decision to step down from the longest format was in line with his belief in grooming the next generation of cricketers.
            Dhoni continued to play in limited-overs cricket, where he scored over 10,000 runs in ODIs, including 10 centuries and 73 half-centuries. His finishing ability in ODIs became legendary, often taking games deep and guiding India to victory in tense situations.
            On August 15, 2020, Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket, ending a glorious 16-year career. His retirement was met with an outpouring of emotions from fans and fellow cricketers worldwide, acknowledging his contributions to Indian and world cricket.
            Post-retirement, Dhoni remains active in the IPL, continuing to captain CSK. His influence extends beyond the field, as he is seen as a mentor and an inspiration to young cricketers. Dhoni's legacy is not just in his records but in his leadership, sportsmanship, and the calm confidence he brought to the game.
            MS Dhoni's career is a testament to hard work, determination, and the ability to stay cool under pressure. He will be remembered as one of the greatest captains and finishers in the history of cricket, leaving behind a legacy that will inspire future generations for years to come.
